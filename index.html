## Government has failed us. 

And more than 90% of us link that failure to the influence of ***money in politics.*** 

Politicians ignore this influence and spend endless time fundraising, from donors who expect big favors when they write big checks.

## Corruption holds our Republic hostage. 

We're going to pay the ransom to get it back. 

We will kick-start a super PAC big enough to win a Congress dedicated to fundamental reform. 

By 2016.

## A super PAC of, by, for the People

Unlike the super PACs of the billionaires, our super PAC will be funded with small dollar donations and matching funds from non-partisan philanthropists.

Already, we have raised over $1,000,000 from over 11,700 people who pledged an average of $86.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture widget2right %}

## All Or Nothing

When you pledge, that money will only be collected if we hit $5M in total pledges, donations, and checks by July 4th, 2014

The idea is simple: If we can't raise enough to make a difference, you don't pay. It's all-or-nothing.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture widget3left %}

## A Path to Victory

Once we raise the money, we'll take on five congressional races in 2014.

We'll hire the best, most badass campaign shops, media advisors, and canvassers.

 We'll not only fight to get pro-reform candidates elected, but we will also make sure everyone knows that political corruption was the determining issue of the race.

{% endcapture %}


{% capture widget3right %}

## Restoring the Republic

What we learn in 2014's contests will serve us in the coming battle in 2016. 

We'll devise strategies, and come back, bigger, and in stronger force, to win an unassailable majority in Congress committed to fundamental reform. 

We believe this to be possible. 

We know this to be necessary.

# MAYDAY 

Will you answer the call? 

Please pledge if you can. 

Please share this site with everyone you can. 

And please know this: 

We still have the power to restore our Republic. 

We will, if you help.
